# Second code image generator

A fork of [ray.so](https://ray.so) for generating Second-branded code images.

This is Second's fork of the excellent ray.so project originally built by [Raycast](https://raycast.com). We use it to generate branded code images for our bitcoin payment solutions and other projects. We forked the project to add our own Second theme!

## What we're building

[Second](https://second.tech) is building bitcoin payment solutions. We share a lot of technical content with our community, you'll find a lot of these code images [posted on our X](https://x.com/2ndbtc)!

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
